;; The full WASM build is produced from packages/creation-core via emscripten
;; (see ../../creation-core/CMakeLists.txt, the EMSCRIPTEN target). This hand-
;; written module is a minimal, dependency-free proof of concept that the WASM
;; bridge in ../src/wasm.ts instantiates and calls at runtime, matching the CPU
;; reference (a box has 24 vertices). The assembled bytes live in ../src/wasm.ts.
