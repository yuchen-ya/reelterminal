# ReelTerminal Desktop — Distribution Guide

How to build, sign, notarize, and ship the desktop app for **macOS, Windows, and Linux**.

Packaging is `electron-builder` (config: `apps/desktop/electron-builder.yml`). The renderer is the `apps/web` build, bundled into the app and served over a hardened `app://` protocol. Native export/transcode use a bundled `ffmpeg` binary per platform.

---

## 1. Build commands

```bash
# from apps/desktop
pnpm build            # builds renderer (apps/web) + main/preload (tsup)
pnpm pack             # electron-builder --dir : unpacked .app, NO signing/notarization (local testing)
pnpm dist             # full installers (dmg/zip, nsis, AppImage/deb) WITH signing + notarization
```

`pnpm pack` is for local smoke-testing; it produces an ad-hoc-signed app that only runs on your machine. `pnpm dist` produces the real, distributable artifacts and requires the credentials below.

---

## 2. ffmpeg binaries (automated)

The app spawns a bundled `ffmpeg` from `resources/bin/<platform>-<arch>/ffmpeg[.exe]` (resolver: `apps/desktop/src/main/sidecar/ffmpeg-path.ts`). Binaries are **gitignored** and fetched on demand:

```bash
pnpm --filter @reelterminal/desktop fetch:ffmpeg          # host platform's slots
node apps/desktop/scripts/fetch-ffmpeg.mjs --all       # every slot
```

`fetch-ffmpeg.mjs` downloads pinned, **statically-linked** GPL builds from `eugeneware/ffmpeg-static` (release `b6.1.1`), verifies each against a hardcoded SHA256, writes them into `resources/bin/<slot>/`, and refreshes `MANIFEST.json`. It is wired into `pnpm pack`/`pnpm dist` and the release CI. The macOS host fetches **both** `darwin-arm64` and `darwin-x64` because the mac runner builds both arches. These builds link only system frameworks (VideoToolbox/AudioToolbox/AVFoundation) and include `libx264`/`libx265`/`prores`/AAC — verified self-contained (`otool -L` shows no `/opt/homebrew`).

**Licensing:** these are **GPL** builds (x264/x265). ffmpeg is invoked as a separate process (not linked), so this is GPL-compatible; ship attribution per `LICENSES/FFMPEG.md` (a product/legal decision to finalize).

> The macOS bundled ffmpeg is **signed** as part of the app bundle when a Developer ID identity is configured (electron-builder signs bundled binaries automatically).

---

## 3. macOS signing + notarization

**Signing identity** — configured in `electron-builder.yml` as
`Developer ID Application: Augustus Otu (864H636QW4)` (Team ID **864H636QW4**),
which is present in this machine's keychain. For CI, install the same Developer ID
cert via `CSC_LINK` (base64/path to a `.p12`) + `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`.

**Notarization** — `mac.notarize.teamId: 864H636QW4` is set; `notarytool` is
installed (Xcode). Provide credentials ONE of two ways:

```bash
# Option A: saved keychain profile (simplest locally) — run once:
xcrun notarytool store-credentials reelterminal-notary \
  --apple-id "you@example.com" --team-id 864H636QW4 \
  --password "abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop"        # app-specific password (appleid.apple.com)
export APPLE_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE=reelterminal-notary

# Option B: env (CI) — Apple ID:
export APPLE_ID="you@example.com"
export APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD="abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop"
export APPLE_TEAM_ID="864H636QW4"

# Option B': env (CI) — App Store Connect API key (preferred for CI):
export APPLE_API_KEY="/path/to/AuthKey_XXXX.p8"
export APPLE_API_KEY_ID="XXXXXXXXXX"
export APPLE_API_ISSUER="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

Then `pnpm dist` signs with the Developer ID, staples the notarization ticket, and produces a Gatekeeper-passing dmg/zip. Without credentials, `pnpm dist` fails on the notarize step (use `pnpm pack` for unsigned local builds).

---

## 4. Windows signing

Provide an OV/EV Authenticode certificate via env (used by electron-builder for the NSIS installer):

```bash
export CSC_LINK="/path/to/win-cert.pfx"   # or base64 of the .pfx
export CSC_KEY_PASSWORD="…"
```

In the release CI these come from the `WIN_CSC_LINK` / `WIN_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` secrets. (Without them, the Windows installer is unsigned and triggers SmartScreen warnings — acceptable for internal testing only; the release workflow still builds it.)

---

## 5. Hosting + auto-update (R2 → dl.openreel.video)

Built apps are **not** on GitHub Releases. They live in a Cloudflare **R2**
bucket served at **`https://dl.openreel.video`**, which hosts:

- the installers — `ReelTerminal-<version>-arm64.dmg`, `-x64.dmg`, `-x64.exe`, `-x86_64.AppImage`, `-amd64.deb` (electron-builder's arch token differs per target: x64 → `x86_64` for AppImage, `amd64` for deb),
- the electron-updater feed (`latest.yml`, `latest-mac.yml`, `latest-linux.yml`, `*.zip`, `*.blockmap`),
- `manifest.json` — the human-download index the landing page reads.

`electron-builder.yml` sets `publish: { provider: generic, url: https://dl.openreel.video }`, so each build embeds that update feed and emits `latest*.yml` + blockmaps (the generic provider does not upload — the CI does, §6).

**Self-update flow** (`src/main/updater.ts`, `initAutoUpdater`): on launch it checks the R2 feed in the background (`autoDownload = false`). When a newer version exists the renderer shows an **update banner** (`apps/web/src/desktop/UpdateBanner.tsx`); the user clicks **Download** (`window.reelterminal.updater.download()` → in-app progress) and then **Restart & Install** (`updater.install()`), which quits through the normal flow so `autoInstallOnAppQuit` applies the update **after** the unsaved-changes guard. Nothing downloads or installs without consent.

Caveats: macOS install requires the build to be **signed** (Squirrel.Mac) — the CI does not upload an unsigned mac update feed; Linux auto-update is **AppImage** only (not `.deb`). The DMG/installers are always uploaded for manual download regardless of signing.

### R2 setup (one-time, in the Cloudflare dashboard)

1. **Create a bucket** (e.g. `openreel-desktop`).
2. **Attach the custom domain** `dl.openreel.video` to the bucket (R2 → bucket → Settings → Public access → Custom Domains). This makes objects public at `https://dl.openreel.video/<key>`.
3. **Create an R2 API token** (Account → R2 → Manage API Tokens) with Object Read & Write on that bucket; note the Access Key ID + Secret + your Account ID.
4. **CORS** so the landing (a different origin) can `fetch` `manifest.json` — already configured on the bucket via `wrangler r2 bucket cors set` for `https://openreel.video`, `www.`, `app.`, and `localhost:5173/3000` (dev). The desktop updater runs from the main process and is not CORS-bound. Add any new landing origin (e.g. a `*.pages.dev` preview) to that policy.

---

## 6. Release CI (build → R2)

> **Historical — no active pipeline.** The inherited `release.yml` workflow
> this section describes was **removed** from this fork (repository-hygiene
> PR): it published to the upstream project's R2 bucket and signing
> identities, which this lab does not own. Pushing a `v*` tag here builds
> nothing. The text below is kept as the upstream design record; a future
> real release pipeline needs its own design, credentials, and identities.

`.github/workflows/release.yml` runs a `quality` gate (typecheck + tests) then
builds all three platforms on a matrix (macos → dmg/zip arm64+x64, windows →
nsis x64, ubuntu → AppImage/deb x64) on a `v*` tag (or `workflow_dispatch` with
`publish: true`). Each runner fetches ffmpeg, builds renderer+main, packages
with `electron-builder --publish never`, then **uploads to R2** via `aws s3`
(R2's S3 API). A final `manifest` job builds + uploads `manifest.json`.

Signing degrades gracefully: signed when the cert secret is present, unsigned
otherwise (the unsigned mac update feed is withheld). Set these encrypted Actions
**secrets**:

| Secret | Used for |
|---|---|
| `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` | R2 S3 endpoint (`https://<id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`) |
| `R2_BUCKET` | the bucket name (e.g. `openreel-desktop`) |
| `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | R2 API token credentials |
| `MAC_CSC_LINK` / `MAC_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` | Developer ID `.p12` (base64) + password |
| `APPLE_ID` / `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` / `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | notarization (`864H636QW4`) |
| `WIN_CSC_LINK` / `WIN_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` | Authenticode `.pfx` (base64) + password |

**Cutting a release:** bump `apps/desktop/package.json` version, commit, push a
matching `vX.Y.Z` tag to the (private) origin. CI builds, uploads to R2, and
writes `manifest.json` — clients then see the update and the landing page shows
the new downloads. No manual publish step.

### Landing page

`../openreel-landing` renders a desktop download section
(`components/DesktopDownload.tsx`) that fetches `https://dl.openreel.video/manifest.json`
at runtime and shows per-OS buttons (OS-detected primary CTA + all-platforms
list). No rebuild of the landing is needed for a new desktop version — it reads
the live manifest.

## 7. App identity

- Product name: **ReelTerminal** · appId: `video.reelterminal.desktop` · version: `apps/desktop/package.json`.

## What we (the product owner) must provide
1. ~~ffmpeg binaries / GPL attribution / auto-update~~ — **done** (§2, §5).
2. **R2 + subdomain** (one-time): create the bucket, bind `dl.openreel.video` to it, mint an R2 API token (§5), and set `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` / `R2_BUCKET` / `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` as CI secrets.
3. **macOS signing**: `MAC_CSC_LINK` / `MAC_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` + `APPLE_ID` / `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` / `APPLE_TEAM_ID` (§3, §6) — required for mac auto-update to install.
4. **Windows signing**: `WIN_CSC_LINK` / `WIN_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, or accept unsigned Windows (§4).
5. Fill in the real support / source-offer contact in `LICENSES/FFMPEG.md`.


## Live CLI distribution

Windows packages include `reelctl.cmd` next to `ReelTerminal.exe`, and a second
copy in `resources/bin`. Invoke the launcher by absolute path when the install
folder is not on PATH. It runs the packaged CLI through Electron's bundled Node
runtime (`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`), so users do not need a separate Node install.
The `reelterminal-live-mcp.cmd` and `openreel-live-mcp.cmd` root launchers retain
old MCP entry names and forward to `reelctl mcp serve`.

A source build exposes `dist/reelctl/index.js` (Node executable) and retains the
old executable `dist/live-mcp/index.js` path for existing MCP configurations.
The desktop does not install an Agent, change its configuration or start stdio
MCP automatically. The GUI's Agent Access switch enables the local Command API.

Packaging acceptance must invoke the actual `.cmd` launcher against the packed
`app.asar`, including an offline `--help` check; testing only package.json bin
entries does not validate this path. See ADR 0010 for protocol and migration rules.
